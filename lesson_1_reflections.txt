How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    This would be really helpful. You could waste a lot less time looking for typos and bugs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It is prone to user error. In my case I think that I would not save often enough leafing big changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because project often span more than one file and it is about tracking the project

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log will show you the commits and you can use diff to see what was changed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because you know that you can revert back to the correct files
